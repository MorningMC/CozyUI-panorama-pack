A simple Minecraft resource pack that contains panoramas in CozyUI+, and also modified skybox!
Works with [Optifine](https://optifine.net/) or [Nuit](https://modrinth.com/mod/nuit) (with [Nuit Interop](https://modrinth.com/mod/nuit-interop)).

**DO NOT enable shaders since some of them will overwrite the skybox!**

May be helpful to animators.
